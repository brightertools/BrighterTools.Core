# Release 1.0.1 — 2026-09-17

This release updates the existing library; SQL Server defaults and host-owned
persistence registration remain unchanged. The proposed production SQLite
expansion is cancelled. Existing SQLite samples/tests do not establish a new
production-support commitment.

## Changes

- Update compatible stable dependencies and .NET 10 servicing packages.
- Preserve existing BrighterTools integrations except where explicitly noted below.
- Validate Release builds and packages before publication.

## Dependency alignment

Add net10.0 alongside net9.0. SkiaSharp is now 4.152.0; applications with direct
SkiaSharp or platform-native asset dependencies must align those versions.

## Publication

Use `.github/workflows/publish-tool.yml` on the release commit. The workflow
validates before publishing and uses the production environment with registry
trusted publishing. Registry policies must authorize this repository and workflow;
a locally built package is not proof of successful publication.
